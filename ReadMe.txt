For my choice of attenuation I went with the UE windowed approach.  I had tried out a few of the different approaches and this is the one I settled on mostly because it looked the best and provided the most evidence that it was working, unlike othes such as the fixed min exponential falloff which only showed light when in very close proximity to an object.  UE windowed also allowed for a somewhat simple calculation with easily changeable variables that made it even better for seeing how the attenuation was affect in the project itself.  It also generally looked good, seemed fairly realistic, and had the backing of it being what a well-respected game making system uses.
